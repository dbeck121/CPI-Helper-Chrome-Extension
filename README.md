|-|-|-|-|

This Browser Plugin extends the SAP Cloud Platform Integration with some useful features.

For news about CPI-Helper please follow our [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kangoolutions)

I recommend reading the readme first but if you know what you are doing, you can add it to your Chrome or Edge Browser directly:
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sap-cpi-helper/epoggeaemnkacpinjfgccbjakglngkpb)
[Edge Browser](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sap-cpi-helper/chnohkopccdfgpglplooonoaigfgfkda)
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/cpi-helper/)

## Privacy and Data Protection

The plugin does not collect personal data. Nevertheless the stores like Chrome Web Store collect some anonymous data like how many users have the plugin installed. Additionally I collect some statistical data like how many users really use the plugin and which features they are using. I work on CPI-Helper in my free time so I want to make sure to only work on functionality that is realy used. I do not trust Google Analytics and other tools so I implemented my own solution to be sure to not send any personal data

I guarantee:

- No personal data is collected
- No urls, tenant names iflow names etc are collected
- only statistical data is collected
- the data does not leave

It is open source so feel free to check the source code.

## Installation

You need Google Chrome to install this plugin. I tested it with version 100. I assume that older versions will work too.
There are two options to install this plugin:

### Install directly from Chrome Web Store or Microsoft Store (recommended)

Just add the plugin in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sap-cpi-helper/epoggeaemnkacpinjfgccbjakglngkpb), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/cpi-helper/) or [Microsoft Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sap-cpi-helper/chnohkopccdfgpglplooonoaigfgfkda).
This is probably the easiest way. Updates will be installed automatically.
[![Chrome Web Store](https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-uploads/image/WlD8wC6g8khYWPJUsQceQkhXSlv1/YT2Grfi9vEBa2wAPzhWa.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sap-cpi-helper/epoggeaemnkacpinjfgccbjakglngkpb)

### Install in Developer Mode from Sources

#### Google Chrome

If you know what you are doing, you can install the plugin directly from sources.
Clone the repo and add the folder directly to Google Chrome

> - Download or clone the repo from github. Unpack if necessary.
> - In Google Chrome, Navigate to Settings – > Extensions
> - Enable Developer Mode (slider on the top-right)
> - Click: "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the folder with the plugin data

#### Firefox

Since version 3.2.0 the plugin is also available for Firefox and can be installed directly from the browser. This is only a developer preview so bugs might occur. https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/cpi-helper/

## Update

Attention: If you installed the plugin from Chrome Store before 21 March 2020, please uninstall and install it again with the link on the top.
Chrome updates extensions that are installed from the Chrome Web Store automatically.
If you installed the plugin from sources:
Please replace the folder with the new version on your disk. After that, you must delete and add the plugin to Chrome Browser.
If you have cloned the repository, pull new data. Then delete and add the plugin in Chrome. Restart Chrome.

## Usage

### New Buttons

If you open an Integration Flow, the plugin will automatically add a "Messages", a "Trace" and an "Info" button in the Integration-Flow-Designer.

#### Message Button

The "Message" button opens a small draggable sidebar with the last processed messages. You can jump directly to infos and traces of the message run. If you hover over the status icon of message, you will see a pop-up with the error message directly. If you click on the time button, InlineTrace is activated (Only when trace was activated for message). If you click on a color coded integration flow item and trace is available, a pop-up opens with the trace of the message at this point.

#### Trace Button

The "Trace" button sets the loglevel of the current Iflow to trace.

#### Info Button

The "Info" button lets you see detailed information of the deployment state of your Integration Flow.

### Toolbar Popup

The button of the plugin in the toolbar gives you a list of useful links of your current tenant. It includes last visited Integration Flows.

See also the [SAP Community Blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/03/05/cpi-chrome-plugin-to-enhance-sap-cloud-platform-integration-usability/#)

### Inline Trace

On the message sidebar, press the time button next to the status icon of a processed message. If run steps exist, the elements of the Integration Flow will change colors accordingly. This will give you a quick overview of the run.

> - Blue elements are successfully processed steps
> - Red elements are elements with errors.
>   SAP does not provide good information about errors. So when an error at a Splitter-Element occurs, this does not have to mean that the error occurred here. It can also be a catched error from elements after the Splitter.

Run steps exist for processed messages with trace and for a short time in processed messages with errors.

### Inline Trace - Show Headers, Properties, Trace, Error and Logs

If you activated the Inline Trace feature, you can get more details. Traces only exist for processed messages with loglevel trace and will be deleted after around about 1 hour by SAP.

## FAQ

### How can I activate InlineTrace?

Run a message with trace activated. You see the message in the message sidebar. Click on the button with the time for the specific message. If trace is available, items that processed the message change color. You can click on integration flow elements to see the trace message before this step.

### How long is the trace available?

SAP deletes trace messages after a while. Trace messages normally do not live longer than 1 hour.

### Trace Mode or other features are not working. Is there a debug mode?

In case of problems, you can contact me and send a debug log. You can activate the debug log while visiting an deployed IFlow, extend the url with ?cpihelper_debug=true&cpihelper_debug_download_duration=60000 and press enter to load again. Try to reproduce the error and after 60s, the debug log will download automatically. Send this to me via mail or linkedin.

Example url: https://xxxxxtrial.integrationsuite-trial.cfapps.us10-001.hana.ondemand.com/shell/design/contentpackage/test/integrationflows/test?cpihelper_debug=true&cpihelper_debug_download_duration=60000

Please send me the debug log and answer the following questions:

- What is the url of the Cloud Integration Tenant?
- Trial Account?
- Custom URL?
- Neo or Multicloud?
- Does the error occur all the time or only sometimes.

We all work in IT and I guess we all know that a message like "My CPI Helper does not work, please help!" will definetely not help you. I need more information.
