# Connectivity Credentials Manager - Progress Report
## Date: 2025-09-09

## Project Goal
Create a Chrome extension plugin for SAP CPI Helper that saves and loads form data on the SAP Cloud Integration connectivity test page (`/shell/monitoring/Connectivity`).

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Initial Analysis
- Discovered existing 2445-line plugin was too complex and unreliable
- Decided to create a clean, simpler implementation from scratch

### 2. Created New Plugin (789 lines)
- **File**: `plugins/connectivityCredentialsManager.js`
- Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Multi-phase form filling approach for handling dynamic fields

### 3. Key Technical Solutions

#### Multi-Phase Form Filling
Implemented 3-phase approach with proper timing:
- **Phase 1 (0ms)**: Checkboxes and radio buttons - triggers dynamic fields
- **Phase 2 (700ms)**: Select dropdowns - triggers more dynamic fields  
- **Phase 2.5 (1200ms)**: Dynamic checkboxes/radios that appear after dropdowns
- **Phase 3 (2000ms)**: Text fields and remaining elements

#### SAP UI5 Checkbox Fix
Discovered that SAP UI5 checkboxes don't respond to regular clicks. Solution:
```javascript
element.focus();
const spaceEvent = new KeyboardEvent('keydown', {
    key: ' ',
    code: 'Space',
    keyCode: 32,
    which: 32,
    bubbles: true
});
element.dispatchEvent(spaceEvent);
```

#### Element Finding Strategies
Multiple fallback strategies for finding elements:
1. Direct ID lookup
2. ID without double underscore prefix
3. Partial ID matching
4. Keyword extraction from camelCase
5. Pattern matching for specific element types

### 4. Current Status

#### ✅ Working Features
- **Checkboxes**: All working including dynamic ones
- **Radio buttons**: Working except Host Key Validation
- **Select dropdowns**: Working with fallback click method
- **Text inputs**: All standard text fields working
- **Dynamic field detection**: Successfully detects and fills fields that appear after interactions
- **Profile management**: Save/load/delete profiles with nice UI

#### ❌ Known Issues
1. **Host Key Validation radio button**: Not found - might only appear under specific conditions
2. **Location ID field**: Not visible even after selecting "On-Premise" proxy type

### 5. Testing Results
- First load: Most fields fill correctly
- Second load: Sometimes fills remaining fields (timing issue partially resolved)
- SSH tab: All major elements working except noted issues

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

### High Priority
1. **Fix Host Key Validation radio**
   - Investigate when this radio button appears
   - May need to check different Authentication Methods
   - Add more aggressive searching in Phase 2.5

2. **Fix Location ID field**
   - Investigate exact conditions for visibility
   - May need longer wait time after Proxy Type selection
   - Consider adding Phase 4 for very late fields

### Medium Priority
3. **Test other tabs** (TLS, FTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, AMQP, Kafka, Cloud Connector)
   - Each may have unique field types or behaviors
   - Document any tab-specific issues

4. **Add adaptive waiting**
   - Instead of fixed timeouts, wait for specific elements to appear
   - Use MutationObserver to detect when dynamic fields are ready

### Low Priority
5. **Code optimization**
   - Reduce redundant code between extraction and filling phases
   - Consider creating reusable element finder function

6. **Enhanced error handling**
   - Better feedback when fields can't be filled
   - Retry mechanism for failed elements

## Technical Notes

### Chrome Storage Key
- Profiles stored under: `connectivityCredentialsManager---profiles`

### Debug Commands
To see what's happening:
1. Open Chrome DevTools Console
2. Look for `[ConnectivityPlugin]` messages
3. Check which phase is running and what fields are being processed

### File Structure
```
plugins/
  connectivityCredentialsManager.js       (main plugin - 789 lines)
  connectivityCredentialsManager.js.backup (backup before refactoring)
  connectivityDataManager.js              (old 2445-line version - deleted)
```

### Git Status
- Branch: `feature/connectivity-credentials-manager`
- Last commit: "feat: Refactor connectivity credentials manager with multi-phase form filling"
- All changes committed

## User Feedback Summary
- "vis co je zajimave? ze kdyz dam load profile poprve, tak se nahraji jenom nektere polozky - ale kdyz to dam podruhe tak se nahraji i ostatni"
  - This timing issue was partially resolved with the multi-phase approach
  
- "pockej - ale ted uz formular vyplnil jak mel - takze tohle bych povazaval za uspech!!!"
  - Success with checkboxes after implementing keyboard event solution

- "ale cekaji nas dalsi vyzvy - na dalsi zalozce - ssh - jsou jine typy elementu - radiobutton, select"
  - Successfully added support for these element types

## Contact for Tomorrow
Continue work on remaining issues. Plugin is functional for most use cases but could be improved for edge cases and specific field combinations.
